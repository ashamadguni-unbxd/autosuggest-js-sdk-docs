1.4 containerTag (String, Optional)

This configuration defines the HTML tag used to create the autosuggestion container element in the DOM. It allows you to control the semantic structure of the rendered autosuggest container based on your application’s markup requirements.

Default: "div"

Examples: "div", "section", "ul"

Use this option when you want the autosuggest container to be rendered using a specific HTML tag for styling, accessibility, or layout consistency.
