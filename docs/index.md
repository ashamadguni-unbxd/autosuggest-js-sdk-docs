## Introduction

## Introduction

The **Autosuggest JS SDK** is a lightweight JavaScript library that enables
real-time search suggestions as users type into a search input. It helps guide
users toward relevant queries and products by dynamically presenting suggestions
based on partial input.

By surfacing meaningful suggestions early in the search journey, Autosuggest
reduces typing effort, minimizes zero-result searches, and improves overall
search efficiency. This results in faster discovery, higher engagement, and a
more intuitive search experience for end users.

The SDK is designed to be easy to integrate and flexible to configure. It can be
used with any web application—regardless of framework—and does not require build
tools or additional dependencies. Once initialized, Autosuggest listens to user
input events and fetches relevant suggestions from Unbxd in real time.

This documentation provides a complete reference for integrating and using the
Autosuggest JS SDK, including setup instructions, configuration options,
available methods, event callbacks, and best practices for implementation.
