## Use Case 1: Focused Autosuggest with Initial Request and Trending Searches

This use case demonstrates how to configure the new Autosuggest JS SDK to provide a discovery-first search experience by displaying suggestions immediately when the search input gains focus.

By enabling `initialRequest` and `trendingSearches`, the SDK fetches and displays popular search terms even before the user begins typing. This approach improves engagement and supports product discovery by highlighting trending queries.

![Use case 1: Trending searches on focus — suggestions appear on focus, then update as you type]({{ 'assets/images/demo-1.gif' | relative_url }})

### Configuration Overview

This behavior is achieved using the following API configuration options:

- **`initialRequest: true`**  
  Triggers an API request as soon as the search input receives focus, without requiring user input.

- **`trendingSearches`**  
  Enables trending search terms in the autosuggest response and allows configuration of the number of results to display.

### Implementation Example

```javascript
const autosuggest = new Autosuggest({
  siteKey: "your-site-key",
  apiKey: "your-api-key",

  inputBoxConfigs: {
    searchInput: ".search-input",
    debounceDelay: 300,
    minChars: 2,
  },

  suggestionBoxConfigs: {
    containerTag: "div",
    attributes: {
      class: ["unbxd-autosuggest-box"],
    },
    template: MyCustomTemplate,
  },

  apiConfigs: {
    apiEndpoint: "https://search.unbxd.io",
    initialRequest: true,
    trendingSearches: { count: 8 },
    topQueries: { count: 4 },
    keywordSuggestions: { count: 3 },
    inFields: { count: 2 },
    popularProducts: { count: 2, fields: [] },
    promotedSuggestions: { count: 2 },
  },

  onEvent: ({ eventType }) => {
    console.log("Autosuggest event:", eventType);
  },
});
```
