## Prerequisite

Before proceeding with the installation of the Autosuggest JS SDK, you must complete the initial onboarding and configuration of your Unbxd account through the Self Serve Dashboard. This setup includes account registration, site creation, feed upload, and relevancy configuration, which are required for the SDK to function correctly.

Detailed guidance on completing the onboarding process is available in the Self Serve Dashboard documentation:
[Self Serve Dashboard Documentation](https://unbxd.com/docs/site-search/integration-documentation/onboarding-flow/)

## Include the SDK

    <script src="https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v1/autosuggest.min.js"></script>

## Include Default Styles

To apply the default Autosuggest UI styles, include the SDK stylesheet:

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://libraries.unbxdapi.com/search-sdk/v1/autosuggest.min.css" />
